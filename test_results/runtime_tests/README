USAGE and COMPILATION:
See ../core_tests/README

All the core runtime classes (Event, EventQueue 
AbstractRuntime via RunnableTest) seem to be working, 
ran simple functional tests and a concurrency test
with RunnableTest (extends RunnableInterface) which handled
concurrent addition and polling of events correctly.
Classes should now be ready for use.
